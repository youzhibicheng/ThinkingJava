/******************************************************************************
* This class is a homework assignment;
* A <CODE>BagWithReceipts</CODE> is a collection of references to Objects.
* Each time an Object is placed in the bag, an integer receipt is provided.
* The receipt can later be used to retrieve the Object.
*
* <dl><dt><b>Limitations:</b> <dd>
*   (1) Beyond <CODE>Int.MAX_VALUE</CODE> elements, this bag no longer works
*   because of arithmetic overflow.
*   <dd>
*   (2) Because of the slow linear algorithms of this class, large bags will have
*   poor performance.
*
* <dt><b>Note:</b><dd>
*   This file contains only blank implementations ("stubs")
*   because this is a Programming Project for my students.
*   My students implement this by storing the elements on a linked list and
*   using receipts 1, 2, 3...
